	"culture": "Belgian waffles originated in Belgium, particularly in the city of Brussels, in the early 18th century. They were first sold by street vendors and quickly became a popular snack throughout the country. Belgian waffles are known for their thick and fluffy texture, which is achieved by using yeast in the batter. They are traditionally served with powdered sugar, whipped cream, and strawberries, but can also be topped with a variety of other ingredients such as chocolate, fruit compote, or even savory toppings like ham and cheese. Belgian waffles gained international popularity in the 1960s and are now a popular breakfast and brunch item around the world.",
	"recipe": "To make Belgian waffles, start by whisking together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. In a separate bowl, beat together eggs, milk, and vanilla extract. Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture and stir until just combined. Then, fold in melted butter. Preheat a Belgian waffle maker and lightly grease with cooking spray. Pour batter onto the waffle maker and cook until golden brown and crispy. Serve with toppings such as whipped cream, fresh berries, or syrup.",
